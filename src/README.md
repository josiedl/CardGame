- ~~~~~~~~~~ How to Play GoFish ~~~~~~~~~~
  ∆ Each player starts with a hand of 5 cards no matter what (players draw until they get 5 cards with no pairs)
  ∆ The objective of the game is to collect the most pairs
     ∆ Collect pairs by creating matches of the same fish
  ∆ Take turns asking each other if they have a card you want
     ∆ ex: "Do you have a...?"
        ∆ If yes, they must give you that card, you may create a pair, and then you may continue asking for cards until they respond no
           ∆ Players draw cards whenever a card is used (you may get lucky and make a pair!)
        ∆ If no, they will respond "Go Fish!"---then you must draw a card
  ∆ Play until there are no cards left in play (every card has a pair)
  ∆ Whoever has the most pairs wins!
  ∆ Have fun!
